## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Goals

Transform the existing Streamlit-based RAG prototype into a production-grade system with:
- FastAPI backend with provider-agnostic architecture
- Modern ingestion pipeline (Docling, document-aware chunking, contextual enrichment)
- Advanced query pipeline (hybrid search, dedicated reranking, corrective RAG)
- React/Next.js frontend with streaming chat
- Comprehensive evaluation and testing

### 1.2 Sprint Cadence

- **Sprint length**: 2 weeks
- **Total sprints**: 8 (16 weeks)
- **Phases**: 5 (mapped from SRS Section 10.1)

### 1.3 Phase-to-Sprint Mapping

| Phase | Name | Sprints | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation | Sprints 1-2 | Project scaffolding, provider abstractions, Qdrant, basic API |
| 2 | Ingestion Pipeline | Sprints 3-4 | PDF parsing, chunking, enrichment, embedding, background jobs |
| 3 | Query Pipeline | Sprints 5-6 | Hybrid retrieval, reranking, corrective RAG, streaming |
| 4 | Frontend | Sprints 6-7 | Next.js app, chat UI, document management, settings |
| 5 | Evaluation & Polish | Sprint 8 | RAGAS/DeepEval, Docker Compose, observability, docs |

---

## 2. Development Methodology

### 2.1 Approach

- **Backend-first**: The FastAPI backend is built and tested before the frontend, using OpenAPI docs and httpx for validation.
- **Provider-at-a-time**: Each provider abstraction (embedding, LLM, reranker) is implemented with one concrete provider first (the default), then additional providers are added as separate tasks.
- **Test alongside code**: Unit tests are written in the same sprint as the feature, not deferred. Integration tests follow once dependent components exist.
- **Vertical slices**: Each sprint delivers a working increment that can be tested end-to-end (via API or CLI), not just isolated modules.

### 2.2 Testing Strategy

| Layer | When Written | Runner | Coverage Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit tests | Same sprint as feature | pytest | >= 80% per module |
| Integration tests | Sprint after dependencies land | pytest + fixtures | Key paths |
| API tests | Same sprint as route | pytest + httpx | All endpoints |
| Frontend tests | Same sprint as component | Vitest + RTL | Core interactions |
| E2E tests | Sprint 8 | Playwright | Critical user flows |
| RAG evaluation | Sprint 8 | RAGAS + DeepEval | Metric thresholds from SRS 9.1 |

---

## 3. Git Workflow

### 3.1 Branch Strategy

```
main                          ← production-ready, protected
  └── develop                 ← integration branch for sprint work
       ├── feat/S1-xxx        ← feature branches per task
       ├── fix/S2-xxx         ← bug fix branches
       └── chore/S1-xxx       ← tooling, config, infra
```

### 3.2 Branch Naming Convention

```
<type>/S<sprint>-<short-description>

Examples:
  feat/S1-fastapi-scaffold
  feat/S2-qdrant-hybrid-search
  fix/S3-chunker-token-count
  chore/S1-docker-compose
```

### 3.3 Merge Rules

- All merges to `develop` require a PR with passing CI (lint + tests).
- `develop` is merged to `main` at the end of each sprint (sprint release).
- Squash merges for feature branches; merge commits for `develop` → `main`.
- No direct commits to `main` or `develop`.

### 3.4 Commit Convention

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore, ci
Scopes: api, ingestion, query, providers, frontend, storage, config, eval
```

|---|---|---|---|
| S2-01 | **Qdrant client wrapper** | FR-5.1, FR-5.2, FR-5.4 | `QdrantStore` class wraps `qdrant-client`. Creates collections with named dense (HNSW, 1024d) and sparse vectors. CRUD operations for points with full payload schema. Configurable connection URL. Unit tests with in-memory Qdrant. |
| S2-02 | **Qdrant hybrid search** | FR-7.1, FR-7.2, FR-7.3 | `QdrantStore.hybrid_search()` performs prefetch on both dense and sparse named vectors, fuses with RRF (configurable k). Returns ranked results with scores. Metadata filtering support (document_id, collection). Unit tests verify RRF ranking logic. |
| S2-03 | **Sparse vector generation** | FR-4.2 | BM25 sparse vector encoder using Qdrant's `FastEmbed` or `rank_bm25`. Tokenizes text, produces sparse index/value pairs. Integrated into storage pipeline. Unit tests. |
| S2-04 | **Collections API** | FR-5.3, 8.1 | `POST/GET/GET{id}/PUT/DELETE /api/collections` fully implemented. Creates corresponding Qdrant collection on POST. Cascading delete removes Qdrant collection + all documents. Pydantic request/response schemas. API tests with httpx. |
| S2-05 | **Documents API (upload & metadata)** | FR-1.6, FR-1.7, 8.1 | `POST /api/documents/upload` accepts multipart PDF upload, validates file type + size (NFR-3.2, NFR-3.3), saves to disk, creates document record with metadata (hash, size, page count via pypdf for now). `GET /api/documents` with collection/status filters. `GET /api/documents/{id}`. `DELETE /api/documents/{id}` removes file, DB record, and Qdrant points. API tests. |
| S2-06 | **Basic query endpoint** | 8.1, 8.2 | `POST /api/query` accepts query + collection_ids, embeds query via OpenAI provider, performs hybrid search on Qdrant, returns raw ranked chunks (no reranking or generation yet). Validates response schema matches SRS 8.2 structure. API tests. |
| S2-07 | **Health endpoint** | FR-15.1 | `/api/health` checks Qdrant connectivity, embedding provider reachability, LLM provider reachability. Returns structured status per dependency. |

**Sprint 2 Deliverable**: Full collections and documents CRUD via API. PDF upload stores file + metadata. Basic query returns hybrid-search results from Qdrant. Health endpoint reports dependency status.

### Sprint 3: Ingestion Pipeline — Parsing & Chunking

**Phase**: 2 — Ingestion Pipeline
**Goal**: Docling PDF parsing, document-aware chunking with parent-child relationships, background ingestion jobs.

| ID | Task | SRS Refs | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| S3-01 | **Docling PDF parser** | FR-1.1, FR-1.2, FR-1.3 | `DoclingParser` class wraps `docling.DocumentConverter`. Converts PDF to structured Markdown preserving headers, tables, lists, reading order. OCR enabled for scanned pages. Extracts document metadata (title, author, language). Unit tests with sample PDFs (text-heavy, table-heavy, scanned). |
| S3-02 | **PyMuPDF4LLM fallback parser** | FR-1.4 | `PyMuPDF4LLMParser` class wraps `pymupdf4llm`. Converts PDF to Markdown. Same interface as Docling parser. Unit tests. Performance benchmark vs Docling on same PDFs. |
| S3-03 | **Parser abstraction and factory** | NFR-4.1 | `DocumentParser` ABC with `parse(file_path) -> ParseResult` method. `ParseResult` contains markdown text, document metadata, and per-page data. Factory selects parser from config. Unit tests for factory. |
| S3-04 | **Document-aware chunker** | FR-2.1, FR-2.2, FR-2.3, FR-2.4 | `DocumentChunker` class. First pass: `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` splits on H1-H3 headers. Second pass: `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with `tiktoken` token counting (512 tokens, 50 overlap) for oversized chunks. Each chunk carries metadata: header_chain, page_numbers, chunk_index. Unit tests verifying header preservation, token limits, overlap. |
| S3-05 | **Parent-child chunk relationships** | FR-2.5, FR-11.1 | Chunker produces two tiers: parent chunks (structural sections from header split) and child chunks (token-limited sub-chunks). Child chunks reference parent via `parent_chunk_id`. Both stored in Qdrant; children used for retrieval, parents available for context expansion. Unit tests verifying relationship integrity. |
| S3-06 | **Background ingestion orchestrator** | FR-1.7, FR-1.8 | `IngestionPipeline` class orchestrates: parse → chunk → embed → store. Runs as FastAPI background task. Updates `ingestion_jobs` and `documents` status at each stage. Atomic per document (failure rolls back Qdrant points). Re-ingestion deletes old points before inserting new. Integration test for full pipeline with small PDF. |
| S3-07 | **Wire upload to ingestion pipeline** | FR-1.7 | `POST /api/documents/upload` triggers background ingestion. `POST /api/documents/{id}/reingest` re-processes with optional new settings. `GET /api/documents/{id}` returns current ingestion status. API tests for async upload → poll status → complete flow. |

**Sprint 3 Deliverable**: Uploading a PDF triggers background ingestion: Docling parsing → document-aware chunking → embedding → Qdrant storage. Status trackable via API. Parent-child chunk hierarchy stored.

For each chunk, calls LLM (via LLMProvider) to generate 1-3 sentence contextual summary describing the chunk's position and topic within the document. Summary prepended to chunk text before embedding. Cache summaries in DB keyed by chunk content hash. Configurable enable/disable. Unit tests with mocked LLM. |
| S4-02 | **Enrichment integration into pipeline** | FR-3.1 | `IngestionPipeline` includes enrichment step between chunking and embedding. `ingestion_jobs` status includes `enriching` state. Skipped when disabled in config. Integration test verifying enriched chunks have contextual prefix. |
| S4-03 | **Cohere embedding provider** | FR-4.4 | `CohereEmbeddingProvider` implements `EmbeddingProvider`. Supports `embed-v4` with configurable dimensions (Matryoshka). Batch embedding with retry. Unit tests with mocked API. |

| S4-05 | **Ollama embedding provider** | FR-4.4 | `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` implements `EmbeddingProvider`. Calls local Ollama API. Unit tests with mocked HTTP. |
| S4-06 | **Embedding model tracking** | FR-4.7 | Each Qdrant point payload includes `embedding_model` field. Hybrid search filters to only match chunks with the currently configured embedding model. Warning logged if collection contains mixed models. Unit tests for filtering. |
| S4-07 | **Ingestion pipeline integration tests** | NFR-5.2 | End-to-end integration tests for the full ingestion pipeline: upload PDF → parse (Docling) → chunk (document-aware) → enrich (contextual) → embed (OpenAI) → store (Qdrant). Verify chunk count, metadata correctness, parent-child links, Qdrant point payloads. Test with 3 sample PDFs (text, tables, mixed). |

**Sprint 4 Deliverable**: Full ingestion pipeline with contextual enrichment. Multiple embedding providers available. Model tracking prevents cross-model contamination. Integration tests validate the complete pipeline.

| S5-01 | **Multi-query expansion** | FR-6.1, FR-6.2 | `QueryExpander` class. Given a query, calls LLM to generate 2-3 alternative phrasings. Returns list of query strings. Configurable enable/disable. Unit tests with mocked LLM verifying diverse phrasings. |
| S5-02 | **Cohere reranker provider** | FR-8.1, FR-8.2 | `CohereRerankerProvider` implements `RerankerProvider`. Calls Cohere Rerank 3.5 API. Accepts query + list of document texts, returns `RerankResult` list with scores. Configurable top_k. Unit tests with mocked API. |
| S5-03 | **Cross-encoder reranker provider** | FR-8.3 | `CrossEncoderRerankerProvider` implements `RerankerProvider`. Uses `sentence-transformers` `CrossEncoder` with `BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3`. Runs locally. Unit tests with small model. |
| S5-04 | **Parent-child context expansion** | FR-11.1, FR-11.2, FR-11.3 | `ContextAssembler` class. Given retrieved child chunks, optionally fetches parent chunks from Qdrant. Modes: `off` (children only), `parent` (replace children with parents, deduplicated), `siblings` (children + adjacent chunks). Enforces token budget. Unit tests for each mode and budget enforcement. |
| S5-05 | **Query pipeline orchestrator** | FR-6, FR-7, FR-8, FR-11 | `QueryPipeline` class orchestrates: expand → hybrid search → rerank → assemble context. Configurable at each stage. Returns assembled context with metadata (scores, query variations, chunk provenance). Integration test with seeded Qdrant data. |
| S5-06 | **Multi-collection search** | FR-7.4, FR-7.5 | `QueryPipeline` accepts list of collection IDs. Searches across all specified Qdrant collections. Merges and reranks across collections. Metadata filtering by document, date range. Unit tests. |
| S5-07 | **Wire query API to pipeline** | 8.1, 8.2 | `POST /api/query` uses full `QueryPipeline`. Request schema accepts all options from SRS 8.2. Response includes answer placeholder (raw context for now) + sources + metadata. API tests validating full response shape. |

**Sprint 5 Deliverable**: Query API performs multi-query expansion → hybrid search across collections → reranking (Cohere or local) → context assembly with parent-child expansion. Returns ranked, assembled context with full metadata.

System prompt instructs grounded answers only. Response includes source citations (document name, pages, header chain, score). Configurable system prompts. Unit tests with mocked LLM. |
| S6-02 | **Corrective RAG** | FR-9.1, FR-9.2, FR-9.3, FR-9.4, FR-9.5 | `RelevanceValidator` class. After reranking, calls LLM to score top chunks' relevance to query (0-1). If below threshold (configurable, default 0.5), reformulates query via LLM and triggers second retrieval pass. Max 2 attempts. If both fail, returns "insufficient context" message. Configurable enable/disable. Unit tests for both pass and fail paths. |
| S6-03 | **Integrate corrective RAG into query pipeline** | FR-9 | `QueryPipeline` includes validation step between reranking and generation. Metadata tracks `corrective_rag_triggered` and `retrieval_attempts`. Integration test with intentionally poor initial results triggering retry. |
| S6-04 | **WebSocket streaming endpoint** | FR-10.3, 8.1 | `WS /ws/query` accepts query message, streams answer tokens in real-time via `LLMProvider.generate_stream()`. Sends final message with sources and metadata after stream completes. Connection lifecycle management (open, message, close, error). Integration test with WebSocket client. |
| S6-05 | **Conversations API** | 8.1, FR-13.5, FR-13.7 | `POST/GET/GET{id}/DELETE /api/conversations` fully implemented. Messages stored with role, content, sources JSON. `POST /api/query` with `conversation_id` appends previous Q&A as context. API tests. |
| S6-06 | **Next.js project scaffold** | 6.2 | `frontend/` initialized with Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, pnpm. shadcn/ui installed and configured. App layout with sidebar navigation (Chat, Documents, Collections, Settings). Zustand store skeleton. TanStack Query provider. `pnpm dev` serves at localhost:3000. |

### Critical Path

The longest dependency chain determining minimum project duration:

```
S1-03 → S1-05 → S1-06 → S2-01 → S2-02 → S3-06 → S5-05 → S6-01 → S6-04 → S7-01
config   ABCs    embed   qdrant  hybrid  ingest   query   gen     stream   chat UI
                                 search  pipeline pipeline
```

This chain spans Sprints 1-7 and represents the core data flow from configuration through to the user-facing chat experience. All other work runs in parallel with this chain.

## 6. Risk Register

| ID | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | **Docling parsing quality insufficient for complex PDFs** | Medium | High | PyMuPDF4LLM fallback parser ready from Sprint 3. Vision parser available as escape hatch in Sprint 8. Evaluate Docling against 10 real-world PDFs before committing. |
| R2 | **Qdrant sparse vector / hybrid search API changes** | Low | Medium | Pin `qdrant-client` version. Wrap all Qdrant calls in `QdrantStore` abstraction. Integration tests catch breaking changes. |
| R3 | **LiteLLM compatibility issues with some providers** | Medium | Medium | LiteLLM provider is one implementation of the `LLMProvider` interface. Direct Anthropic/OpenAI providers can be added as fallbacks without architectural changes. |
| R4 | **Contextual enrichment cost explosion on large documents** | Medium | Medium | Enrichment is configurable (disable by default for large documents). Cache summaries to avoid re-computation. Use fast/cheap model (Haiku-class) for enrichment. Monitor token usage per ingestion job. |
| R5 | **WebSocket streaming reliability** | Low | Medium | Implement reconnection logic in frontend client. Fall back to non-streaming `POST /api/query` if WebSocket fails. Heartbeat/ping-pong to detect stale connections. |
| R6 | **Frontend/backend schema drift** | Medium | Low | Generate TypeScript types from backend Pydantic schemas (or maintain shared type definitions). API tests validate response shapes. |
| R7 | **RAG evaluation metrics don't meet thresholds** | Medium | High | Thresholds are tunable. Evaluation identifies which pipeline stage is the bottleneck (retrieval vs generation). Iterate on prompts, chunking strategy, or reranking before adjusting thresholds. |
| R8 | **Docker Compose resource constraints on local machines** | Medium | Medium | Document minimum hardware requirements. Qdrant and Ollama are memory-hungry — provide guidance for non-GPU machines. Ollama is optional. |

## 7. Definition of Done

A task is "done" when all of the following are met:

### Code
- [ ] Implementation complete and handles edge cases
- [ ] No regressions in existing tests (`pytest` passes, `ruff check` clean)
- [ ] New unit tests written with >= 80% coverage for new code
- [ ] Integration tests written where the task involves cross-component interaction
- [ ] Code follows project conventions (Conventional Commits, structured logging, type hints)

### Review
- [ ] PR submitted to `develop` with description linking to task ID
- [ ] CI pipeline passes (lint, type check, tests)
- [ ] PR reviewed and approved (or self-reviewed for solo development)

### Documentation
- [ ] Public API changes reflected in Pydantic schemas (auto-documented via OpenAPI)
- [ ] Complex logic has inline comments explaining "why", not "what"
- [ ] Config changes documented in `.env.example` or `config.yaml`
