## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the requirements for a comprehensive rewrite of the rag2compare project, upgrading it from a Streamlit-based prototype to a production-grade, general-purpose Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a React/Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend.

### 1.2 Scope

The system enables users to upload PDF documents (and potentially other document types), process them into searchable embeddings, and query them using natural language with LLM-generated answers grounded in the source material. It must handle text-heavy documents, structured tables, charts/diagrams, and scanned pages.

### 1.3 Design Principles

- **Provider-agnostic**: All LLM, embedding, and reranking providers are swappable via configuration. No hard dependency on any single vendor.
- **Local-first deployment**: The entire system runs self-hosted. Cloud APIs are used for embeddings/LLM calls but no managed SaaS infrastructure is required for storage or compute.
- **Offline-capable where practical**: Embedding and LLM layers support local model alternatives (Ollama, sentence-transformers) even though online operation is the default.
- **Evaluate before optimizing**: Every retrieval and generation improvement must be measurable against a baseline.

### 1.4 Target Scale

| Dimension | Target |
|---|---|
| Document corpus | 100 - 1,000 PDFs |
| Document size | 1 - 500+ pages per PDF |
| Concurrent users | 1 - 20 |
| Query latency (p95) | < 5 seconds end-to-end |
| Ingestion throughput | ~10 pages/second sustained |

### 1.5 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Chunk** | A segment of a document, with metadata, stored as an embedding vector |
| **Dense retrieval** | Semantic similarity search using embedding vectors |
| **Sparse retrieval** | Keyword-based search (BM25) |
| **Hybrid search** | Combination of dense and sparse retrieval, fused via RRF |
| **RRF** | Reciprocal Rank Fusion — algorithm that merges ranked lists from multiple retrievers |
| **Reranking** | A second-pass scoring of retrieved chunks using a cross-encoder or dedicated reranker model |
| **Contextual retrieval** | Prepending document-level context to each chunk before embedding |
| **Corrective RAG** | Post-retrieval validation that reformulates queries when initial results are poor |

---

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Current System (v1.0)

The existing application is a single-process Streamlit app with the following pipeline:

```
PDF upload → pypdf extraction → RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (1000 chars) →
OpenAI text-embedding-3-small → ChromaDB → cosine similarity (top-10) →
LLM-based reranking (top-3) → LLM answer generation → Streamlit chat UI
```

**Key limitations:**
- pypdf loses all document structure (tables, headers, layout)
- Character-based chunking ignores document semantics
- No hybrid search (dense-only retrieval)
- LLM-based reranking is slow, expensive, and unreliable
- No evaluation framework to measure quality
- Streamlit UI is not suitable for production use
- Tightly coupled — no API layer for integration

### 2.2 Target System (v2.0)

```
Document upload → Docling AI parsing (Markdown) → Document-aware chunking →
Contextual enrichment → Dual embedding (dense + sparse) →
Qdrant hybrid search → Dedicated reranking → Corrective RAG loop →
LLM answer generation → React/Next.js UI
```

All served behind a FastAPI backend with a clean REST API.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Document Ingestion

#### FR-1: PDF Parsing

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-1.1 | The system SHALL parse PDF documents using Docling (IBM) as the primary parser, producing structured Markdown output preserving headers, paragraphs, tables, lists, and reading order. |
| FR-1.2 | The system SHALL support OCR for scanned PDF pages via Docling's integrated Tesseract/EasyOCR support. |
| FR-1.3 | The system SHALL extract tables into Markdown table format, preserving row/column structure. |
| FR-1.4 | The system SHALL provide a fallback parser (PyMuPDF4LLM) for fast bulk processing when document structure preservation is not critical. |
| FR-1.5 | The system SHALL support vision-based parsing as an optional mode, using a multimodal LLM (e.g., Claude, GPT-4o) to interpret page screenshots for documents with complex charts, diagrams, or non-standard layouts. |
| FR-1.6 | The system SHALL extract and store document-level metadata: title, author, page count, creation date, file size, and detected language. |
| FR-1.7 | The system SHALL track ingestion status per document: queued, parsing, chunking, embedding, complete, failed. |
| FR-1.8 | The system SHALL support re-ingestion of previously processed documents (e.g., after parser upgrade) without duplicating entries. |

#### FR-2: Chunking

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-2.1 | The system SHALL use document-aware chunking via `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` as the primary strategy, splitting on document structure (headers H1-H3) when Markdown output is available. |
| FR-2.2 | The system SHALL apply a secondary `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` pass to break oversized structural chunks into token-limited segments (target: 512 tokens, 50-token overlap). |
| FR-2.3 | The system SHALL use token-based sizing (via `tiktoken`) rather than character-based sizing. |
| FR-2.4 | The system SHALL preserve chunk hierarchy metadata: parent section title, header chain (e.g., "Chapter 3 > Section 3.2 > Subsection 3.2.1"), source page number(s), and position within document. |
| FR-2.5 | The system SHALL store parent-child relationships between chunks: small chunks (children) are used for retrieval, and their enclosing section (parent) is available for expanded context delivery to the LLM. |

#### FR-3: Contextual Enrichment

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-3.1 | The system SHALL prepend a contextual summary to each chunk before embedding, generated by an LLM. The summary SHALL describe where the chunk fits within the overall document (section, topic, relationship to surrounding content). |
| FR-3.2 | The contextual summary SHALL be 1-3 sentences and follow this format: `"This chunk is from [section/location] of [document title], discussing [topic]. [Additional context about what precedes/follows this chunk.]"` |
| FR-3.3 | The system SHALL cache contextual summaries so they are not regenerated on re-embedding with the same parser output. |
| FR-3.4 | Contextual enrichment SHALL be configurable (enable/disable) since it adds LLM cost per chunk during ingestion. |

#### FR-4: Embedding

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-4.1 | The system SHALL generate dense vector embeddings for each chunk using a configurable embedding provider. |
| FR-4.2 | The system SHALL generate sparse vectors (BM25 term frequencies) for each chunk to support hybrid search. |
| FR-4.3 | The default embedding provider SHALL be OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` at 1024 dimensions. |
| FR-4.4 | The system SHALL support the following embedding providers via a common interface: OpenAI, Cohere, Jina, Sentence-Transformers (local), and Ollama (local). |
| FR-4.5 | The system SHALL support Matryoshka dimension reduction for providers that offer it (OpenAI, Cohere, Jina), configurable via settings. |
| FR-4.6 | The system SHALL process embeddings in configurable batches with retry logic and exponential backoff. |
| FR-4.7 | The system SHALL track embedding model identity per chunk so that chunks embedded with different models are not mixed in search results. |

#### FR-5: Storage

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-5.1 | The system SHALL store all vectors in Qdrant, running locally via Docker. |
| FR-5.2 | Each Qdrant collection SHALL contain both dense vectors (HNSW index) and sparse vectors (sparse index) for the same chunks. |
| FR-5.3 | The system SHALL support multiple named collections, allowing users to organize documents into separate searchable groups. |
| FR-5.4 | The system SHALL store the following metadata per chunk in Qdrant payload: source document ID, filename, page number(s), header chain, chunk index, chunk token count, contextual summary (if generated), and embedding model identifier. |
| FR-5.5 | Document-level metadata (title, author, status, upload date, file hash) SHALL be stored in a relational database (SQLite by default, PostgreSQL as optional upgrade). |

### 4.2 Query Pipeline

#### FR-6: Query Processing

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-6.1 | The system SHALL support multi-query expansion: given a user query, generate 2-3 alternative phrasings via LLM to improve recall. All phrasings are searched independently and results merged. |
| FR-6.2 | Multi-query expansion SHALL be configurable (enable/disable) to allow low-latency mode for simple queries. |

#### FR-7: Hybrid Retrieval

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-7.1 | The system SHALL perform hybrid search combining dense vector similarity and sparse BM25 keyword matching. |
| FR-7.2 | Results from dense and sparse retrieval SHALL be merged using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) with a configurable k parameter (default k=60). |
| FR-7.3 | The system SHALL retrieve a configurable number of initial candidates (default: 20) before reranking. |
| FR-7.4 | The system SHALL support filtering by collection, document, date range, and custom metadata tags during retrieval. |
| FR-7.5 | The system SHALL support searching across multiple collections in a single query. |

#### FR-8: Reranking

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-8.1 | The system SHALL rerank retrieved candidates using a dedicated reranking model, NOT a general-purpose LLM. |
| FR-8.2 | The default reranker SHALL be Cohere Rerank 3.5. |
| FR-8.3 | The system SHALL support the following reranker providers via a common interface: Cohere Rerank, cross-encoder models (local, via sentence-transformers), and BGE-reranker-v2-m3 (local). |
| FR-8.4 | The reranker SHALL reduce the candidate set to a configurable number of final chunks (default: 5) for context assembly. |
| FR-8.5 | Reranking scores SHALL be preserved in the response for transparency and debugging. |

#### FR-9: Corrective RAG

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-9.1 | After reranking, the system SHALL evaluate whether the top-ranked chunks are relevant to the query using an LLM relevance check. |
| FR-9.2 | If the relevance score falls below a configurable threshold, the system SHALL automatically reformulate the query and perform a second retrieval pass. |
| FR-9.3 | The system SHALL perform at most 2 retrieval attempts (initial + one retry) to bound latency. |
| FR-9.4 | If both attempts fail to find relevant context, the system SHALL inform the user that the available documents do not contain sufficient information to answer the query, rather than hallucinating an answer. |
| FR-9.5 | Corrective RAG SHALL be configurable (enable/disable) for latency-sensitive use cases. |

#### FR-10: Answer Generation

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-10.1 | The system SHALL generate answers using a configurable LLM provider. |
| FR-10.2 | The system SHALL support the following LLM providers via a common interface: Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), Ollama (local models), and any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. Provider routing SHALL be handled via LiteLLM. |
| FR-10.3 | The system SHALL stream responses to the frontend via WebSocket for real-time display. |
| FR-10.4 | The system SHALL include source citations in every answer: document name, page number(s), section header, and relevance score for each referenced chunk. |
| FR-10.5 | The system SHALL provide the retrieved chunks alongside the generated answer so the user can inspect the source material. |
| FR-10.6 | The system prompt SHALL instruct the LLM to answer only from provided context, acknowledge when context is insufficient, and never fabricate information. |
| FR-10.7 | The system SHALL support configurable system prompts for different use cases (e.g., summarization, Q&A, analysis). |

#### FR-11: Parent-Child Context Expansion

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-11.1 | When a small chunk is retrieved, the system SHALL have the option to expand context by retrieving its parent chunk (the enclosing section). |
| FR-11.2 | Context expansion SHALL be configurable: off (return matched chunk only), parent (return enclosing section), or siblings (return matched chunk plus adjacent chunks). |
| FR-11.3 | The total assembled context SHALL respect a configurable token budget (default: 8,000 tokens) to stay within LLM context limits. |

| FR-12.6 | The frontend SHALL support bulk upload of multiple PDFs. |

#### FR-13: Chat Interface

| FR-13.4 | The user SHALL be able to click a source citation to view the full chunk text, document name, page number, and relevance score. |
| FR-13.5 | The frontend SHALL support multiple chat sessions (conversations) with independent history. |
| FR-13.6 | The user SHALL be able to select which collection(s) to search against for each conversation. |
| FR-13.7 | The chat interface SHALL support follow-up questions within the same conversation, with previous Q&A pairs available as context. |

#### FR-14: Settings & Configuration

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-14.1 | The frontend SHALL provide a settings page to configure LLM provider, embedding provider, and reranker provider with API keys and model selection. |
| FR-14.2 | The frontend SHALL provide controls for retrieval parameters: chunk count, reranking top-k, context expansion mode, multi-query expansion toggle, corrective RAG toggle. |

## 9. Evaluation & Quality Assurance

### 9.1 RAG Evaluation Framework

The system SHALL include an evaluation suite that measures retrieval and generation quality.

#### Metrics

| Metric | Tool | Target | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Faithfulness** | RAGAS | >= 0.85 | Does the answer only contain information from the provided context? |
| **Answer Relevancy** | RAGAS | >= 0.80 | Does the answer actually address the user's question? |
| **Context Precision** | RAGAS | >= 0.75 | Are the retrieved chunks relevant to the query? |
| **Context Recall** | RAGAS | >= 0.70 | Did retrieval find all the relevant information? |
| **Latency (p95)** | Custom | < 5s (standard), < 10s (full pipeline) | End-to-end response time |
| **Cost per query** | Custom | Tracked | Total API cost (embedding + reranking + LLM) |

#### Evaluation Dataset

- A curated test set of >= 50 question-answer pairs across multiple documents
- Covers factual recall, table lookups, multi-document synthesis, and unanswerable questions
- Ground-truth answers provided for context recall measurement
- Maintained in `tests/eval/dataset.json`

#### CI/CD Integration

- DeepEval tests run on every PR as quality gates
- Faithfulness and Answer Relevancy thresholds enforced (fail PR if below threshold)
- Evaluation results logged and tracked over time

### 9.2 Testing Strategy

| Level | Scope | Tools |
|---|---|---|
| **Unit tests** | Individual pipeline stages (parser, chunker, embedder, retriever, reranker, generator) | pytest |
| **Integration tests** | Full ingestion pipeline, full query pipeline | pytest + test fixtures |
| **API tests** | All REST endpoints, WebSocket streaming | pytest + httpx |
| **Frontend tests** | Component rendering, user interactions | Vitest + React Testing Library |
| **E2E tests** | Upload → ingest → query → verify answer | Playwright |
| **RAG evaluation** | Retrieval and generation quality | RAGAS + DeepEval |

## 10. Migration Strategy

### 10.1 Phased Approach

The migration from v1.0 to v2.0 is structured in phases, each delivering independent value:

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up project structure (monorepo with `backend/` and `frontend/`)
- FastAPI backend with provider abstraction layer
- Qdrant integration with hybrid search (dense + sparse)
- Migrate existing ChromaDB data to Qdrant
- Basic REST API for document upload and query
- Unit and integration test foundation

#### Phase 2: Ingestion Pipeline
- Docling PDF parser integration (with PyMuPDF4LLM fallback)
- Document-aware chunking (Markdown splitter + recursive secondary pass)
- Contextual enrichment (LLM-generated chunk summaries)
- Parent-child chunk relationships
- Background ingestion with status tracking

#### Phase 3: Query Pipeline
- Multi-query expansion
- Cohere Rerank integration (with local cross-encoder fallback)
- Corrective RAG loop
- Parent-child context expansion
- Streaming answer generation via WebSocket

#### Phase 4: Frontend
- Next.js application with shadcn/ui
- Document upload and management UI
- Chat interface with streaming and source citations
- Collection management
- Settings and provider configuration

#### Phase 5: Evaluation & Polish
- RAGAS evaluation suite with curated test dataset
- DeepEval CI/CD quality gates
- Structured logging and observability
- Vision-based PDF parsing (optional parser mode)
- Docker Compose deployment configuration
- Documentation

### 10.2 Data Migration

- Existing ChromaDB data can be exported and re-ingested through the new pipeline
- Re-ingestion is recommended (rather than vector migration) since the new pipeline produces higher-quality chunks and embeddings
- The old Streamlit app remains functional during migration
